  <h3>About the Creator</h3>
  <p>When General Assembly student Miblee is not busy being a lazy homebody, she is also an industrious clean freak who would love to own multiple large dogs if only they weren't such a messy and time consuming handful. Maybe one day she'll make enough money from developing games like this to hire house cleaners and dog trainers to make all her canine ownership dreams come true.</p>
